Gradually duplicating the original program using Python 3.
MIEcalculator.py needs modification with the new python-docx for producing the saved report.
I am yet to deal with any GTC issues in the grand-finale.
There are some strange tricks I used in the original in terms of equation choices where I should use kwargs.

As of 18 April 2021 formeqns.py works to read the excel files and allow component by component calculation.
MIEcalculator.py is still revealing problems.

As of 31 May 2021 MIEcalculator is functioning. I have removed the print preview feature as it continues to
to have some unreliable behaviours while not offering any real benefit. The snapshot feature has been updated
and retained but offers marginal given that PrtScr does the same sort of thing in windows.

Pyinstaller has successfully created a dist folder using the GTC_py39 environment. Note that
 pyinstaller -w MIEcalculator.py probably avoids the console coming up, although this will obscure windows
 error messages.

 -w, --windowed, --noconsole Windows and Mac OS X: do not provide a console window for standard
i/o. On Mac OS X this also triggers building an OS X .app bundle. On Windows
this option will be set if the first script is a ‘.pyw’ file. This option is ignored in
*NIX systems.

Inno Setup needs modifications to the wizard script to properly install sub directories by specifically adding the
directory name after {app}

MIEcalculator\wx\*"; DestDir: "{app}\wx"; Flags: ignoreversion recursesubdirs createallsubdirs

Unfortunately, while the install now works, there is a permission problem with using the Program Files folder for
caching calculation steps
PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: 'C:\\Program Files (x86)\\MIEcalculator3\\e_data\\_meter.csv'

So I should shift any write processes to the working directory. These are the e_data folder that holds images, the
Projects directory that might have the report saved and its xls_temp directory for all the .csv files. With full admin
rights this can be sorted. It will be useful to consider os.chdir(path) to shift the working directory, remembering
that os.getcwd() is used to find the icon file. Just need to identify a safe spot for a temporary folder that is
universally available in windows.

Have successfully shifted all graph images into io buffers so no file folder (e_data) is required for them. The
_meter.csv type files (output summaries) are still going to e_data and so will instead put them in the xls_temp
directory. While these intermediate csv files may be dispensed with, it is probably best to retain them until we do a
proper structural change to the calculation. Another option is to shift the _meter.csv etc. files into io buffers. The
reasoning is that the meter.csv etc. input files provide a convenient alternative input path for testing while the
_meter.csv set really are just an internal processing convenience. This will also remove the need to 'clear temporary
files'.

The 'Projects' folder should be installed somewhere like 'Documents' or 'Desktop' to avoid any permission problems
when running them.

Remember to use the 'no window' option for the python exe.

Snapshot now shifter to using project working directory and so it doesn't function until after a project is opened.
This is an unintended consequence of not having a fixed working directory location.

Having some success running MIEcalculator on Centos 7, but GTK does not allow some pythonwx commands.
