Gradually duplicating the original program using Python 3.
MIEcalculator.py needs modification with the new python-docx for producing the saved report.

As of 18 April 2021 formeqns.py works to read the excel files and allow component by component calculation.
MIEcalculator.py is still revealing problems.

and retained but offers marginal given that PrtScr does the same sort of thing in windows.
